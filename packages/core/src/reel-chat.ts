// Editing a reel by typing ("make the captions yellow", "change 'gonna' to 'going to'", "add B-roll of a city here"):
// the customer's message and a compact picture of the reel go to a small LLM, which answers with a short reply and
// changes from a fixed list that covers everything the editor can do. The LLM never writes the edit itself: each change
// is checked here (parseChatOps) and applied here (applyChatOps), and the editor takes the result as one step it can
// undo. Times the LLM sees and answers in are on the cut video's clock (what the customer watches); applying them moves
// them onto the recording's. B-roll it asks for is searched for by the server first, which attaches the clip.
